SICP Exercises
==============

Solutions to the exercises from Abelson and Sussman's SICP.

The Scheme implementation used is Kent Dybvig's [Petite Chez Scheme](http://www.scheme.com/petitechezscheme.html) which conforms to the R6RS standard. Therefore, some of the solutions contain extra code to remain consistent with SICP.
